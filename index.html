							<br>
                            With the increase in demand for low-latency communication in 5G networks and the preva-
                            lence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being proposed as an
                            answer to fulfil the high demands of such networks. There has been a significant need to eval-
                            uate the advantages and disadvantages of deploying UAVs to assist in network communication.
                            This study focuses on reviewing Cooperative Game Theory solutions implemented to solve the
                            specific problem of coordination and collision avoidance between drones in UAV-aided networks,
                            and providing a state-of-the-art on the subject. Lastly, a comparison is drawn between Game
                            Theory and Machine Learning, as both solutions are often proposed together in this context.

							<h5><b>Abstract<b></h5>
							<br>
This document provides a proposal for a literature review on the topic of solving coordination and
mobility problems in UAV-aided Networks with the use of Game Theory models and strategies.
First the concept of UAV networks and game theory is explained. A preliminary literature review
was conducted in order to identify what studies have already been conducted in this area. Finally,
a methodology is proposed for how to conduct this review and provide a state-of-the art on the
subject.
